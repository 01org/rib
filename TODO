[ADM]
=====

Definite
--------
P2 - convert ADM API to use exceptions for errors
P3 - move test utils into a separate .js file
P3 - add ADM unit tests

Need Thought
------------
P2 - higher-level validation like id can only start with alpha character
P1 - consider preventing selection outside of active page, or as Xu suggests,
     making selection outside automatically change active page
P1 - consider moving active page and selection concepts to design node
P2 - consider validating widget registry entries on startup

[Design View]
=============

P1 - When you drag a new item from the palette, it should be displayed in the
     canvas as you drag around. Worst case, maybe insert one and pick it up
     and use it as the draggable? (PTSDK-108)

P2 - Make tools/panels movable to "dock" positions

P3 - Add visual page picker (not a separate dialog).
  * Could be in the toolbar, or a vertical "palette" on the right of
    the screen

P2 - Make all DOM interactions into a "framework" class with well
  defined APIs for things like:
  * change page
  * select object
  * refresh (or reload) page
  * refresh (or reload) document
  * setting framework specific options (e.g. default transitions)
  * generic message handler (?)
  * delete object
  * move object
  * etc...

- Bugs to be fixed:
  * Flip toggle switch widget in the design view cannot be selected.
    - Update 1/3/12: Selectable but ugly and clicks fall through to it
  * The option widget within a select menu does not show correctly in the design view.

[FileIO]
========

P2 - Implement File view/browser for HTML5 localstorage contents
   * In file-manager branch, on hold pending UX feedback

[General]
=========

P2 - Rename template.js to something more appropriate for what it actually
  does, which is handling the embedded design view contents styling and
  behaviors in the framework context as opposed to the GUI Builder JS/CSS
  context

P1 - Separate "controller" and "design view" logic in js/builder.js.  For
  example, split it into two files... and make them more object oriented

P2 - Start saving context for UI states, preferences, current design, etc...

P3 - Menu should perhaps be dismissed when we click an option

P2 - Make a "developer" setting somewhere
   - Show Debug menu only when developer mode is on

P3 - App title is currently always "title" which can't be changed; perhaps
     this can just be removed, or made blank -- or it should be exposed as a
     general property of the design somewhere. If that's to show up in the
     property pane, we would need some way to select the "design".

P2 - It would be nice to preserve the ability to write pure jQuery Mobile apps,
     which would require something like a design setting to turn Tizen widgets
     on or off. Maybe better as a decision you make when opening a new project,
     so we don't have to worry about deleting Tizen widgets if you turn those
     off.

[Palette]
=========

P1 - Convert palette.json and palette.js to be usable for BWidget objects
 Migrate the non-base widgets from widgets.js to palette JSON
  * Base, Design, Page, Header, Footer and maybe Content will remain
    in widgets.js
  * Button, TextInput and others should migrate to a JSON format

P1 - Start adding Tizen "win set" framework widgets to the palette JSON
  * Work has begun in a web-ui-fw branch

P2 - Add additional jQM widgets to the palette JSON:
  * Password Input
  * Validated Inputs (number, email, url, telephone, etc.)
  * Search Input

P2 - Convert the palette to a "palette.d" format, where new, custom palettes
  can be added by simply adding new files into that dir.  Needs some high
  level design documentation.

P1 - Visual cleanup, try making the widget boxes constant width, maybe two wide
  with a smaller font so they'll fit? Ask UX team for a better default icon,
  and maybe a set of icons.

[Properties]
============
P2 - Properties pane header text should have some margin from palette
     - Apparently the "jQuery Mobile Widgets" button is covering part of it

P2 - Only display the (uid=92) when in "developer mode" (see [General])

[Serialize]
===========

[Template]
==========

P2 - Create additional templates

P2 - Add a "template picker" at startup and pre-populate the content area with
  selected template

[Widgets]
P1 - Provide real UX icons for widgets
P2 - Perhaps display placeholder text in TextInput to guide user
     (e.g. Enter hint text here) -- but only in design canvas
P2 - Very uncommon to actual set TextInput's "value" to a hard-coded initial
     state; we should consider removing the property (for now I've at least
     moved it to the bottom of the TextInput properties)
P3 - Someday we might want to distinguish between the order properties are
     listed in properties pane and the order they are written in codegen
P3 - Could make form elements based on a common FormElement to inherit
     the name attribute
P3 - Whether or not to wrap widget and label with a fieldcontain could be
     an option on the widget
P2 - Add the ability to insert simple HTML at any point in the design:
       text, <p> and <br> tags, <h?> tags, <b>, <i>, character entities, ...

[Code Gen]
==========

[Code View]
===========
P2 - Color syntax highlighting would be highly desirable (PTSDK-121)

[Preview]
=========
P2 - If you change pages with a button (e.g. with target "#page2") in the
     preview, it might be nice if we noticed and updated our selection. OTOH,
     maybe not.

P2 - If you navigate as above in the preview, probably when you come back to
     preview later it should start you back on the same page you were looking
     at in the design canvas again. Could use UX thought.

[Outline View]
==============
